# Pyautogui-token-joiner
This is a token joiner made in pyautogui, this means that it moves the mose for you so you cant run this while doing something else.
I think this is a good thing because its very easy to read, and it will never get your tokens banned.


Instructions:
First on your browser download the extension "Discord Token Login"
Then in the code find the "discord.gg/crossite" string and replace it with your own server.
Put your tokens in the tokens.txt file.
Make sure you open the extension so you can see where you put in the tokens !!DO NOT ENTER ANYTHING IN HERE!!
Full screen you browser and start the code.
Now it should automate logging in with the token and joining your server
